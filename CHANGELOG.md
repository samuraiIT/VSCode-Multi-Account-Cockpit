---

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.52] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **AI Credits surfaced across UI**: Added a unified `Credits` display in Status Bar, Account Tree account nodes, and Accounts Overview (card/table/compact views), so available AI credits are visible without opening details.
- **AI Credits in quota snapshot model**: Added `availableAICredits` in quota snapshots, sourced from `loadCodeAssist` (`paidTier.availableCredits`) and passed through HUD/account overview payloads.
- **In-app announcement update**: Added a new popup announcement for the author's self-hosted account/redeem-code shop channel.

### Improved
- **Authorized quota cache replay keeps credits value**: When authorized quota falls back to cached model data, the extension now reuses the last known available AI credits to avoid showing `--` unexpectedly.
- **Cached API snapshot enrichment**: Using cached API responses now attempts a lightweight credits refresh for the selected account, keeping credits display fresher.
- **Status bar sync on account cache updates**: Status bar now listens to account cache update events and syncs display when current-account cached snapshot is refreshed.

### Fixed
- **Credits i18n key synchronization**: Synced the new `dashboard.availableAiCredits` key to all supported locale files to prevent fallback-to-key text in non-Chinese/English locales.

## [2.1.43] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **WSL shared directory resolution for Cockpit Tools**: When the extension runs in WSL, it now resolves Cockpit Tools shared files from the Windows user profile (`%USERPROFILE%/.antigravity_cockpit`) instead of the Linux home directory, so `accounts.json` and `server.json` are read from the actual desktop-side location.
- **WSL WebSocket host resolution for Cockpit Tools**: The desktop WebSocket target now prefers the WSL default gateway, falls back to `/etc/resolv.conf` when needed, and safely formats IPv6 hosts, improving connectivity to the Windows-side Cockpit Tools service.
- **WSL runtime detection and desktop launch path**: WSL detection no longer depends only on a remote name flag; the extension also detects WSL from runtime signals and uses the Windows deep-link launch path in WSL sessions, improving Cockpit Tools startup reliability.

## [2.1.42] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Cockpit Tools launch reliability on Windows**: When command-based launch fails due to command-not-found errors, the extension now retries with the `cockpit-tools://` deep link.
- **Consistent open behavior across entry points**: `Open Cockpit Tools` from Accounts Tree and wake-up risk dialog now share the same desktop launch logic and failure handling path.

## [2.1.41] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- **Auto grouping unified to smart family rules**: First-run grouping and manual `Auto Group` now use the same smart family matcher and persist canonical group names (`Claude`, `Gemini Pro`, `Gemini Flash`, `Gemini Image`) together with group mappings.
- **Antigravity Tools auto import behavior simplified**: In auto mode, Antigravity Tools sync now performs import-only and no longer switches active accounts automatically.

### Removed
- **Auto-switch account feature set removed**: Removed auto-switch threshold config/command, dashboard/auth modal auto-switch toggles, and refresh-time auto-switch execution path.
- **Auto-switch helper module and tests removed**: Deleted `account_auto_switch` service and its test coverage.

## [2.1.40] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Accounts Overview compact view mode**: Added a new `Compact` mode (`▤`) in the view switcher. It shows account rows in a denser layout with inline quota chips and quick actions (`Details` / `Switch` / `Refresh`), while keeping responsive behavior on narrow widths.

### Fixed
- **Invalid persisted view mode fallback**: Persisted webview state now normalizes unknown view modes back to `grid`, avoiding inconsistent active-button state and render behavior.

## [2.1.39] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **Extension crash in WSL / SSH remote environments**: `process.resourcesPath` is an Electron-only global that is `undefined` in remote Node.js extension hosts (WSL, SSH, etc.). The module-level `path.join(process.resourcesPath, …)` call threw a `TypeError` before `activate()` could even run. The path is now lazily resolved with a safe fallback, so the extension loads normally in all remote environments.

## [2.1.38] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **Auto-switch stays enabled after upgrade**: Users upgrading from ≤2.1.36 could see the auto-switch toggle still checked because the old default (`true`) was persisted in VS Code global state. A one-time migration now resets the stored flag to `false`.

## [2.1.37] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **Auto-switch toggle in Settings modal**: The auto-switch checkbox is now accessible from the ⚙️ Settings modal (alongside notification and threshold settings), in addition to the existing Account Sync config modal.

### Changed
- **Auto-switch default changed to OFF**: The automatic account switching feature now defaults to disabled. Users must explicitly enable it in settings.

## [2.1.36] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Accounts Overview email privacy toggle**: Added a toolbar switch to hide/show account emails, with local persistence in webview storage.
- **Official host diagnostics**: Startup logs now include the detected official Antigravity `ideVersion` and official extension version for easier environment troubleshooting.

### Changed
- **Local auth token source selection**: Local account import now explicitly selects token source by key presence (`antigravityUnifiedStateSync.oauthToken` vs legacy `jetskiStateSync.agentManagerInitState`) and logs the selected source.
- **Cloud Code request identity metadata**: Cloud Code metadata now includes official-host-aware `ideVersion`, plugin version, platform enum, update channel, plugin type, and optional `duetProject`.

### Improved
- **Cloud Code eligibility check payload**: `loadCodeAssist` requests now send `mode: FULL_ELIGIBILITY_CHECK` for closer parity with the official flow.
- **Accounts Overview feedback flow**: Non-add action progress now appears in the in-page action message area, and account switch actions immediately display a "Switching..." status.

## [2.1.34] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Automatic account switching**: Added a configurable auto-switch threshold so the extension can switch away from the current account when its quota drops below the chosen percentage.
- **Auto-switch command**: Added a command palette action to update the threshold without editing settings manually.

### Fixed
- **Account rotation stays on healthier accounts**: The new switcher prefers the strongest eligible fallback account instead of bouncing to an equally low account.
- **Threshold update toast formatting**: Fixed duplicate trailing percent signs in the threshold update toast (e.g. `70%%`).

### i18n
- **Auto-switch locale sync**: Added missing auto-switch threshold translation keys across all locale files to prevent fallback key text in non-English/Chinese locales.

## [2.1.33] - 2026-03-25

### Improved
- **Accounts Overview action tooltips are now consistent**: Replaced native `title` tooltips on account action icons (`Details` / `Switch` / `Refresh` / `Export` / `Delete`) with webview-rendered tooltips to avoid inconsistent hover-trigger timing in VS Code webviews.
- **Action hit area enlarged**: Increased action button size in both card and list views to improve hover stability and clickability.
- **Refresh icon visual tweak**: Updated the Accounts Overview refresh action glyph from `⟳` to `↻` for better visual balance with neighboring action icons.

---

## [2.1.32] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **WSL local account import with non-ASCII Windows usernames**: When the extension runs in VS Code Remote - WSL, Windows `%APPDATA%` is now resolved through a Unicode-safe command path, preventing imported database paths from degrading into garbled `/mnt/c/Users/???/...` values for local accounts.

### Engineering
- **WSL path normalization regression coverage**: WSL-resolved `state.vscdb` paths now keep POSIX separators and include regression tests for non-ASCII Windows profile names.

---

## [2.1.31] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **WSL local account import path**: When the extension runs in VS Code Remote - WSL, `Import Local Account` / Account Sync local import now resolves the Windows-side Antigravity client database (`%APPDATA%/Antigravity/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`) instead of reading the remote extension host storage path.
- **Dark High Contrast grouping action contrast**: The `Manage Groups` button now keeps a light, readable label in the `Dark High Contrast` theme.

### Engineering
- **WSL path regression coverage**: Added tests to lock the `state.vscdb` resolution behavior for WSL and non-WSL environments.

---

## [2.1.30] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **"Invalid URL protocol" on local account import**: Fixed an error (`Import failed: Invalid URL protocol: the URL must start with 'http:' or 'https:'`) that occurred when using the "Import from Local DB" feature on certain systems or VS Code versions. The root cause was sql.js loading the `.wasm` file via `fetch()` in some environments, while the old code passed a bare filesystem path (no protocol prefix). The `locateFile` callback is now converted using `pathToFileURL()` to a standard `file://` URL, ensuring correct wasm loading on all platforms.

### Improved
- **Quota history deduplication**: The history details table now shows only data points where the quota percentage actually changed, filtering out duplicate entries with identical values for a cleaner trend view.
- **History countdown format**: The countdown column in the history table now uses a unified compact format, consistent with other time displays.

### Engineering
- **sql.js initialization resilience**: The sql.js initialization Promise cache is now reset on failure, preventing subsequent calls from permanently reusing a failed Promise.

---

## [2.1.29] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **Shared plaintext credential bridge disabled**: The extension no longer exports to or reads from `~/.antigravity_cockpit/credentials.json` and `~/.antigravity_cockpit/current_account.json`.
- **Offline account source updated**: When Cockpit Tools WebSocket is unavailable, account list/current-account state now comes from extension local secure storage only.
- **Legacy key cleanup on account delete**: Deleting an account now also clears the matching legacy single-account key residue.

### Removed
- **Legacy compatibility setting removed**: Deleted `agCockpit.allowInsecureSharedCredentialExport`.

### i18n
- **Removed unused translation keys**: Deleted unused keys `customGrouping.ungroupedCount`, `customGrouping.newModelsDetected`, and `common.dismiss` across locale files.

### Notes
- **Cross-end sync channel**: Plugin-to-Cockpit-Tools credential sync now relies on WebSocket channel events; this release no longer produces file-based shared credential data.

---

## [2.1.28] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Accounts list missing after tab switch (#138)**: Fixed an issue where, when Accounts Overview was in list mode, switching to another tab and back could leave rows empty (checkbox only). The list now re-renders reliably without needing to toggle from grid to list.

---

## [2.1.27] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- **Wake-up risk dialog flow simplified**: The risk dialog now uses a clear three-action flow: `Cancel` / `Continue with Plugin Wake-up` / `Open Cockpit Tools (Recommended)`.
- **Open-or-download behavior**: `Open Cockpit Tools (Recommended)` now attempts to launch Cockpit Tools first and automatically opens the download page when the app is unavailable.
- **Risk copy prioritizes conclusion**: Updated the Chinese risk warning copy to place the conclusion first and explicitly explain the low-frequency wake-up risk expectation.

### Removed
- **Anonymous error reporting removed completely**: Removed the entire error-reporting pipeline (runtime reporter module, capture hooks, settings entries, and build-time DSN injection).

### i18n
- **Locale sync for wake-up actions**: Added missing wake-up dialog action keys (`autoTrigger.openCockpitToolsRecommended`, `autoTrigger.continuePluginWakeup`) across all locale files.

---

## [2.1.26] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- **Auto wake-up default off**: Wake-up remains disabled by default, and users can enable it manually when needed.
- **Enable-time risk prompt**: Turning on wake-up now shows a warning about recently tightened Google risk controls and potential account impact.
- **Announcement source migrated to repo**: Announcement data is now stored in repo-root `announcements.json` / `announcements_dev.json`, and the remote source now reads from this repository's Raw URLs.

---

## [2.1.25] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- **Auto Wake-up schedule save strategy**: Saving wake-up settings now rebuilds a canonical config from defaults and request payload, then writes it back as a full replacement (no legacy merge behavior).
- **Submission-first persistence**: `selectedModels` / `selectedAccounts` now persist strictly from the submitted selection set (after normalization), preventing old residual values from surviving future saves.

### Fixed
- **Stale model residue in wake-up config**: Deprecated/invalid model IDs in wake-up selections are now normalized, deduplicated, mapped to current replacements, and filtered against the current available model list.
- **Startup schedule self-heal**: Existing saved wake-up configs are sanitized on startup and rewritten to storage, cleaning historical invalid entries.
- **Disabled-state trigger guard**: Quota-reset wake-up branch now requires `enabled=true`, preventing accidental trigger branch activation when wake-up is disabled.

---

## [2.1.24] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Deprecated model preference migration**: Saved model preferences now auto-migrate deprecated model IDs to their current replacements during config load and subsequent saves (including visible models, pinned/order entries, custom names, and grouping mappings).

### Changed
- **Smart group naming override**: Clicking `Auto Group` now always applies canonical group names (`Claude`, `Gemini Pro`, `Gemini Flash`, `Gemini Image`) instead of inheriting historical names.
- **Smart group save cleanup**: Saving immediately after `Auto Group` now rewrites group-name mappings using the canonical names and removes stale group-name entries for models outside the current grouped set.
- **Authorized recommended list refresh**: Updated the built-in recommended model list to the current Gemini 3.1 / Claude 4.6 lineup.

### Fixed
- **Custom grouping modal model source**: The grouping manager now uses the full model list (`allModels`) instead of the visibility-filtered list, so models hidden by "Manage Visible Models" still appear in the grouping editor.

### Notes
- Startup shows a one-time informational notice when deprecated model preferences are auto-migrated.

---

## [2.1.23] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Cloud Code quota backend alignment**: Aligned the authorized quota backend fetch flow with `Antigravity.app`, including endpoint routing, request sequence, and onboarding polling behavior.
- **GCP ToS routing application**: The `isGcpTos` route flag is now actually applied when selecting the Cloud Code endpoint, matching desktop behavior.
- **`onboardUser` flow parity**: Switched to the desktop-style flow (`POST` to start + `GET` polling on the returned operation) with a 500ms polling interval.
- **`loadCodeAssist` fallback alignment**: Project resolution now follows the desktop-style `loadCodeAssist` fallback behavior when tier/project data is incomplete.
- **Cloud Code request identity**: Aligned Cloud Code request `metadata` and `User-Agent` construction with the official Antigravity desktop client format.

### Notes
- No UI/UX changes. This release focuses on backend compatibility and quota-fetch reliability improvements.

---

## [2.1.22] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Cache-diff based auto-group assignment**: On fresh authorized API responses, the extension now compares the latest model list with the previous per-account API cache and auto-assigns newly appeared models into existing family groups (Claude / Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash / Gemini Image) without requiring a manual "Auto Group" action.
- **Version-agnostic model grouping**: Smart grouping now supports prefix/pattern matching (in addition to exact IDs), so model family grouping no longer depends on a fixed version list.
- **Unified group naming**: Default group names are now normalized to `Claude`, `Gemini Pro`, `Gemini Flash`, and `Gemini Image`.
- **Webview smart-group coverage**: New Claude/Gemini variants (including future `x` versions) are auto-routed into their target groups instead of being left ungrouped.

### Improved
- **Quota history group consistency**: History aggregation now uses the same version-agnostic matching rules, keeping group lines stable across Gemini/Claude version updates.
- **Fallback grouping consistency**: Reactor fallback grouping (degenerate all-same-quota case) now follows the same family-based grouping strategy as the dashboard.

### Fixed
- **Legacy default-name migration in smart grouping**: Existing default names such as `G3-Pro`, `G3-Flash`, `G3-Image`, `Gemini 3 Pro Image`, and `Claude 4` are auto-normalized to the new naming when auto-grouping is applied.

---

## [2.1.21] - 2026-02-20

### Improved
- **Card Layout Compactness**: Reduced card title font size, tightened spacing, and shrunk drag handles and action buttons for a more compact and information-dense dashboard layout.
- **Model Name Tooltip**: All model names now show a rich tooltip on hover, displaying the full model name (first row) followed by capability details. Removed the standalone ✨ sparkle icon; hovering the model name itself now triggers the tooltip.
- **New Tag Animation**: Model "New" tags now use a transient burst animation that plays a short pulsing effect when the panel becomes visible, then hides automatically after a few seconds. Tags no longer animate indefinitely.
- **Panel Visibility Awareness**: The HUD panel now notifies the webview when it becomes visible (via reveal, tab switch, or serializer restore), enabling visibility-dependent UI behaviors like the New tag burst.

### Changed
- **Default Group Definitions**: Updated default auto-group definitions — renamed "Claude 4.5" to "Claude 4" (now includes GPT-OSS 120B Medium, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6), added Gemini 3.1 Pro models to the G3-Pro group, and renamed "G3-Image" display name to "Gemini 3 Pro Image".
- **Authorized Model Coverage**: The authorized model list now includes all models with valid quota and display names (not just those in the Recommended sort). Fallback models are appended in recommended-rank order, preventing models from being silently hidden.
- **GCP ToS Routing**: Authorized quota and project-ID resolution requests now pass the `isGcpTos` route flag, enabling correct endpoint routing for GCP Terms-of-Service accounts.
- **Official Quota Flow Alignment**: Quota retrieval is now fully aligned with the official authorized flow. The deprecated local mode and its related switching entry points have been removed to reduce branching complexity and improve behavior consistency.

### Fixed
- **Missing ProjectId on Batch Refresh**: When an account's `projectId` is not cached, batch quota refresh now automatically resolves it via `resolveProjectId` before fetching models, instead of failing silently.
- **Status Dot Removed**: Removed the redundant colored status dot from card title bars; the progress circle already conveys the same information.

---

## [2.1.20] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Tools Connection Status**: Added a `🔗 Tools: Online/Offline` status indicator in the sidebar account tree and the Accounts Overview (both card and list views), showing the real-time Cockpit Tools WebSocket connection state.
- **Local Account Data Reader**: New `cockpitToolsLocal` service that reads account data directly from `~/.antigravity_cockpit/accounts.json`, eliminating WebSocket dependency for account ID lookups.

### Improved
- **Account Switch Reconnection**: All three account switch entry points (sidebar, dashboard, accounts overview) now wait up to 5 seconds for WebSocket reconnection before giving up. Previously, switches would fail immediately if the connection was temporarily lost.
- **Account Switch Flow**: Account ID is now resolved from local files before checking WebSocket connectivity. Only the final switch command requires an active WebSocket connection, preventing the "Cannot get account ID" error that occurred when the connection was temporarily lost.

---

## [2.1.19] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Authorized model list policy**: Authorized responses now only display models listed in `agentModelSorts > Recommended > groups[].modelIds`, and always append `gemini-3-pro-image`.
- **Friendly model names**: Authorized model labels now use each model's `displayName` consistently across all views.

---

## [2.1.18] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Extension Host Mode**: Set `extensionKind` to `["workspace"]` to run the extension in workspace host by default, improving Linux/server-side process detection and local process API stability.

### Improved
- **Startup Diagnostics**: Enhanced startup logs for local account auto-detection and process scanner path to make server-mode troubleshooting clearer.

---

## [2.1.17] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **Local quota source**: Local mode now uses the local process API only; removed auto-import and remote API fallback.
- **Model visibility (authorized)**: Switched to blacklist filtering; default selection shows all non-blacklisted models. On upgrade, saved `visibleModels` is reset to show all.
- **Plan Details UI**: The Plan button is shown in local mode and hidden in authorized mode. Default visibility is restored.

### Added
- **Diagnostics**: Log full model lists for local and authorized sources.

---

## [2.1.16] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Quota History Write Guard**: Quota history now records only when data is fetched from real-time network responses. Reads from API cache files now skip history recording to avoid cached points polluting trend calculations.

---

## [2.1.15] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Group Rename UI Sync (Local Mode)**: Fixed an issue where renaming quota groups could succeed in backend config but not update immediately in Dashboard under local mode. Group names now refresh instantly without requiring manual reload.
- **Local Remote-API Reprocess Path**: Improved cache reprocess logic for local mode when using remote authorized quota data, ensuring latest `groupingCustomNames` are applied during re-render.
- **Optimistic Rename Robustness**: Improved optimistic group-name DOM update to avoid selector edge cases with special `groupId` values.

---

## [2.1.14] - 2026-02-06

### Improved
- **Custom Time Save UX**: In schedule configuration, pending custom time input is now auto-applied on save. Users no longer need to click "Add" before clicking "Save Settings".

---

## [2.1.13] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **Extension Host Compatibility**: Updated `extensionKind` to `["ui", "workspace"]` so users can install the extension either locally or in remote environments (WSL / Remote-SSH) based on their workflow.

### Notes
- To keep reading local machine data in remote sessions, users can still force local UI host execution via VS Code `remote.extensionKind` settings.

---

## [2.1.12] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Remote-SSH Support**: Added `extensionKind: ["ui"]` configuration to ensure the extension runs on the local machine even when connected to a remote server via Remote-SSH. This allows users to view their local Antigravity quota information while working on remote projects.

---

## [2.1.11] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- **Antigravity Tools Sync**: Auto-sync feature has been removed from the UI and is now permanently fixed to OFF. Manual import functionality remains available.

### Added
- **Accounts Overview Sorting**: Added new sorting options for the accounts list:
  - Sort by update time (`last_updated`)
  - Sort by group quota (e.g., "By Sonnet Quota")
  - Sort by group reset time (e.g., "By Sonnet Reset Time")

### Improved
- **Local Auth Compatibility**: Added support for reading the new unified state format (`antigravityUnifiedStateSync.oauthToken`) while maintaining backward compatibility with the legacy format (`jetskiStateSync.agentManagerInitState`). This ensures refresh tokens can be read from both old and new Antigravity client versions.

### i18n
- Added translation keys for new sorting options: `sortByLastUpdated`, `sortByGroup`, `sortByGroupReset`, `sortAsc`, `sortDesc` across all 16+ supported languages.

---

## [2.1.10] - 2026-02-03

### Core Enhancements
- **Multi-Instance Support**: The extension can now intelligently detect the runtime IDE instance and correctly read the `state.vscdb` from the current directory, resolving local account confusion in multi-user/multi-workspace environments.

### Added
- **Debug Tool**: Added `agCockpit.debugLocalAccount` command to quickly view the current local account info and database path.

### Improved
- **Path Management**: Refactored filesystem path resolution logic to support dynamically injected user data directories, improving stability in complex environments.

## [2.1.9]

### Added
- **403 Forbidden State Management**: Unified forbidden account flag (`isForbidden`) with a 🔒 red lock icon and "No Permission" tooltip in the sidebar.
  - Detects 403 Forbidden errors and automatically marks account state
  - Automatically skips quota refresh for forbidden accounts

### Changed
- **Cache directory isolation**: Extension quota cache moved to `quota_api_v1_plugin` to prevent sharing/overwriting with the desktop app.

### i18n
- **Internationalization**: Added `accountsRefresh.forbidden` translation key for all supported languages.

## [2.1.8]

### Added
- **Authorized API cache**: Cache raw authorized API responses in `quota_api_v1`.
- **Cache source marker**: Store `customSource` in API cache records to identify the writer.

### Changed
- **Quota refresh**: Read the API cache before network requests and rebuild views from cached payloads.
- **Authorized fetch**: Can honor force refresh while still using cache for normal reads.
- **Legacy cache path**: Corrected legacy cache root to `quota_v2`.

### Removed
- **Processed quota cache**: Removed read/write of the old processed quota cache.

## [2.1.7]

### Added
- **Model display fallback**: Fill readable names for common model IDs when `displayName` is missing.

### Changed
- **Message flow**: Message/Retry flow now hooks into the account refresh service for consistent state updates.

## [2.1.6]

### Added
- **Unified quota refresh entry**: Sidebar, accounts overview, and auto refresh now flow through `QuotaRefreshManager` for consistent behavior.

### Improved
- **Shared file cache**: Batch and auto refresh use the 60-second file cache to prevent duplicate requests across IDEs/workspaces.
- **Auto refresh jitter**: Added randomized offset (>=30s: -10~+10s; <30s: 0~+10s) to reduce synchronized spikes.
- **Dashboard refresh**: In authorized mode, refreshes only the active account via real-time request path.

### Fixed
- **Force refresh**: Concurrent waits no longer fall back to cache, ensuring single-account refresh stays real-time.
- **Copy consistency**: Cached time labels now use i18n strings.

## [2.1.5]

### Added
- **Account Invalid State Management**: Unified management of invalid account flags (`isInvalid`) across the sidebar, accounts overview, and management modal for consistent status display.
  - Invalid accounts in the sidebar now display a ⚠️ red warning icon with "Authorization expired" tooltip
  - Enhanced error detection supports multiple authorization failure types (401 UNAUTHENTICATED, invalid_grant, Authorization expired, etc.)
  - Automatically skips quota refresh for invalid accounts to optimize performance and prevent UI freezing

### Improved
- **Performance Optimization**: Data change notifications (`dataChanged`) now only sync the account list without refreshing quotas.
  - Eliminated high-frequency invalid quota queries caused by credential updates (Token refresh)
  - Quota refresh is now handled exclusively by scheduled tasks and manual operations, significantly reducing resource consumption
  - Newly added accounts temporarily show no quota data with proper "No quota data" placeholder message

### i18n
- **Internationalization**: Added `accountsRefresh.authExpired` translation key with Chinese and English support

## [2.1.4]

### Improved
- **Architecture**: Refactored the dashboard codebase by modularizing CSS styles and JavaScript logic, improving maintainability and load performance.
- **UX**: Enhanced the announcement system to automatically mark notifications as read when the popup is closed, streamlining the user experience.
- **Quota History**: Adjusted history tagging logic: at 100% it now uses countdown deltas for START/RESET, and below 100% it only records entries when the percentage changes.

## [2.1.3]

### Improved
- **UX**: Enhanced the "Cockpit Tools Not Running" warning when switching accounts. Added "Launch" and "Download" buttons for quicker access to the manager tool.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **Accounts Overview Integration**: Migrated the standalone Accounts Overview webview into the main Cockpit HUD for a more seamless experience and improved performance.
- **Internationalization**: Added comprehensive translation support for the new Accounts Overview interface across all 18+ supported languages.

### Changed
- **UX**: The history tab now automatically selects and highlights the currently active account with a checkmark (✅).
- **Architecture**: Refactored `AccountsRefreshService` for more robust account state tracking and reliable periodic refreshes.
- **Performance**: Consolidated webview scripts and assets, reducing the memory footprint and improving response times.

### Fixed
- **Quota History**: Fixed an issue where the 'RESET' tag was not displayed when quota recovered to 100% without a significant timestamp jump.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **Quota History Clearing**: Users can now clear quota history logs.
  - Clear history for a specific account or all accounts globally.
  - Added confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletion.
- **Multilingual Support**: Fully aligned and completed translation keys across all 16 supported languages.
  - Added missing history labels and dashboard details for Russian, Vietnamese, Czech, Polish, Italian, and Arabic.
  - Extensive Turkish translation update including auth and account management flows.
  - Traditional Chinese consistency improvements.

### Changed
- **UI/UX**: Refined the dashboard history table layout with localized headers and time formats.
- **Maintenance**: Standardized i18n key naming conventions (e.g., globalized `history.range*d` keys).

### Fixed
- **i18n**: Resolved duplicate translation blocks in Russian and Polish files.
- **i18n**: Fixed traditional/simplified Chinese mixed characters in certain labels.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-26


### Added
- **Quota History**: History tab to track quota changes.
  - Account/model filters with 24h/7d/30d ranges.
  - Chart + paginated details table (remaining %, delta, reset time, countdown).
  - Local history snapshots; START tag on the first countdown drop at 100%.
  - Auto-refresh while the history tab is active.

### Changed
- **Local Auth Import**: Switched sql.js to the wasm build and copy wasm assets during build.
- **Packaging**: Exclude `out/sql-asm.js` and `out/view/webview/chart.js` from the extension package.
- **Model Definitions**: Centralized recommended model constants for reuse across frontend/backend.


## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Accounts Overview**: Added sort direction toggle (Ascending/Descending) to the toolbar, allowing users to better organize their account list.

### Improved
- **Group Renaming**: Implemented optimistic UI updates for group renaming. The interface now updates immediately upon saving, providing instant feedback without waiting for backend confirmation.

### Fixed
- **Accounts Overview**: Fixed a potential type error when importing refresh tokens (added null check for email).

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed
- **Auto Wake-up**: Fixed multi-account quota reset detection logic. The system now independently checks the quota status of all selected accounts, not just the active account.

### Added
- **Automated Release Workflow**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish to Open VSX Registry when version tags are pushed.
- **One-Click Release Script**: Added one-click release script that automates version number updates, compilation, packaging, tag creation, and push process.

## [2.0.1]

  - Added account operation mutex lock to ensure serialized execution
  - Fixed startup account sync racing with user-initiated operations
  - Fixed deleted accounts being auto-reimported during quota refresh (added auto-import blacklist mechanism)
- **Account Switching**: Fixed auto-switch logic still detecting Antigravity Tools accounts.

### Changed
- **Account Switching**: Account switching now **follows local Antigravity client only** (`state.vscdb`), no longer detects Antigravity Tools.
  - Startup automatically syncs to local client's current login (silent import and switch)
  - "Switch to Current Login" button only detects local client
- **Antigravity Tools Sync**: Auto-sync feature now **only imports accounts, no longer auto-switches**.
- **UI**: Removed the "Auto Switch Account" checkbox and related descriptions from the "Account Sync Settings" modal.

## [1.8.38]

### Fixed
- **UI Consistency**: Fixed a script error in the Dashboard where switching quota sources would freeze the UI due to a missing function call.
- **Offline Sync**: Fixed a state synchronization issue where the correct quota source wasn't displayed in the frontend when the extension was offline.

### Changed
- **Account Switching**: Significant logic rewrite for account switching. The extension now prioritizes detecting the active account in the local Antigravity client (`state.vscdb`) over Antigravity Tools, with robust fallbacks.
- **Account Switching**: Quota data is now immediately refreshed after switching accounts in all modes (authorized/local).
- **Account Switching**: Improved the "Switch to Current Login" button logic to cross-detect accounts from multiple local sources.

### Engineering
- **Linting**: Enabled ESLint for all webview JavaScript files. Fixed dozens of "variable defined but never used" warnings and potential runtime errors.
- **Build**: Integrated ESLint into the build process; `npm run compile` now automatically performs code quality checks before building.

### i18n
- **Wording**: Updated the `alreadySynced` message across all 15 supported languages (e.g., "Already using this account, no switch needed") to be more accurate as it now covers multiple account sources.

## [1.8.37]

### Changed
- **Model Management**: The model manager and quota display now show only recommended models, filtering out non-recommended models (e.g., `chat_*`, `Gemini 2.5 Flash`).
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed the "Select Recommended" button from the model manager toolbar as it's no longer needed.
- **Announcements**: Added scrolling support for announcement popup content when content is too long.

## [1.8.36]

### Fixed
- **Windows Local Auth Import**: Fixed `spawn sqlite3 ENOENT` error on Windows when importing local accounts. Replaced system `sqlite3` command-line tool with pure JavaScript `sql.js` library for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Account Switching**: Fixed issue where manually switching accounts in the Manage Accounts modal would be reverted to the original account during quota refresh.

### Added
- **Switch to Current Login**: Added "Switch to Current Login" button on the authorized account row. Click to quickly sync to the account currently logged in on Antigravity Tools or the local client. If the account exists, it switches directly; if not, an import confirmation dialog appears.

## [1.8.35]

### Changed
- **Model Management**: Unified model management logic for local and authorized sources, ensuring a consistent experience across different quota origins.
- **Model Management**: Local mode now supports automatic sorting (weighted by recommended rank) and default selection of recommended models.
- **UI**: The "Select Recommended" button in the model manager is now always available regardless of the quota source.

## [1.8.34]

- **Auto Wake-up**: Fixed status page mode display showing only the first time point, now shows all time points.
- **Authorized Monitoring**: Removed redundant prompt text when not authorized.

### Migration
- **Why**: Group/model personalization (order, pins, custom names, visibility) grew settings.json, created sync noise, and behaved more like per-device UI state.
- **What**: Move these UI preferences from settings to globalState (no cross-device sync), and clean up legacy settings. Removed list view and the `viewMode` setting.

## [1.6.15]

### Added
